In the future, we would like to explore how this increase in housing units is going to affect the house prices in that area.\n",

        "\n",
        "3. Currently, we only have Inventory as a factor that affects the house price. However, there are some other factors that affect the inventory of sales, such as population increase and number of housing permits. So we would like to study more about the inventory and try to include these parameters in the prediction of house prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. While the price to income ratio graph shows the disproportionate increase in house prices, a possible improvement would be to include data for other nearby metropolitan areas. If the San Jose area's ratio is either rising faster than or is higher than San Francisco or Oakland, then we will be able to emphasize the importance of more local housing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. We see that as total number of house increases,  the ratio of Population to number of house decreases. We might able to tell that the ratio was increasing in the past few years. From here, we can make the projection of population and number of house to be build. Moreover, if we can compare this ratio with other counties, we get the sense what level of ratio is good. \n",
        "\n",
        "6. From point 5, we will have the forecast number of inventory change. Then we can also use this variable as the input to predict the house price. By doing this way, we can interact the visualization of \"Number of House Unit VS Population\"  with  the \"House Price and Inventory for Sales\" visualization. \n"
