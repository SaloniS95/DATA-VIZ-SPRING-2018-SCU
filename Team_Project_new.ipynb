        "We explored some subject matters that we thought were related to housing prices. They are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Lack of new constructions:\n",
        "\n",
        "Not enough homes are being built to accommodate the growing population. In this graph from Redfin, we can see how few the new construction listings are compared to the existing homes.\n",

        "Source : https://www.redfin.com/blog/data-center\n",
        "\n",
        "* Impact of local tax revenue on city planning:\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of tax limits established in 1978 by Proposition 13 (https://www.californiataxdata.com/pdf/Prop13.pdf), local governments generally receive more revenue from sales tax and hotel room tax than from property tax. Proposition 13 limited the property tax rates to 1% of a home's taxable value and restricted how quickly that taxable value could increase after a purchase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Last year, the city of Brisbane hired a consultant who found that the city would make 1 million dollars a year net in tax revenue by approving the 4,400 units development in Baylands. But if the city instead approved a project with a lot more commercial space, a larger hotel and no hoiusing, Brisbane would gain 9 million dollars annually - an amount equivalent to more than half the city's current day-to-day operating budget. \n",
        "\n",
        "This shows that local governments have less incentive to approve residential houses, which has led to a shortage in new housing developments and an increase in the prices of the current houses in the area.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Rising job numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Part of the problem is that while available housing has not increased much, there are constantly more jobs in the Bay Area, especially from tech companies, both large corporations and startups. Looking at the increase in job numbers may highlight why the lack of new housing has such an impact on the overall housing market.\n",

        "\n",
        "One important factor that affects people’s decision while buying houses is whether or not the house is within the boundary of a school with a good API (Academic Performance Index) or high test scores. A survey of nearly 1,000 prospective home buyers showed that 91 percent said school boundaries were important in their search.\n",
        "On average, homes in the best school districts are sold for higher prices as compared to similar homes in less popular school districts.This might give us some insight on the rising house prices.\n",

        "* Housing Regulations\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main issues related to the availability of houses is the low housing density in most parts of the Bay Area. Current regulations in many cities and neighborhoods often not only restrict the size of houses, but also the size of apartment buildings and condominiums. Restrictions on both new construction and expansions has hindered efforts to increase available housing. \n",

Even though we had an idea as to how these matters will relate to each other, there was a high chance that they might interact in a counter-intuitive way. We inspected these relationships and tried to come up with visualizations that will explain them in a simple and concrete way. \n",

In the future, we would like to explore how this increase in housing units is going to affect the house prices in that area.\n",

        "3. Currently, we only have Inventory as a factor that affects the house price. However, there are some other factors that affect the inventory of sales, such as population increase and number of housing permits. So we would like to study more about the inventory and try to include these parameters in the prediction of house prices.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. While the price to income ratio graph shows the disproportionate increase in house prices, a possible improvement would be to include data for other nearby metropolitan areas. If the San Jose area's ratio is either rising faster than or is higher than San Francisco or Oakland, then we will be able to emphasize the importance of more local housing.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. We see that as total number of house increases,  the ratio of Population to number of house decreases. We might able to tell that the ratio was increasing in the past few years. From here, we can make the projection of population and number of house to be build. Moreover, if we can compare this ratio with other counties, we get the sense what level of ratio is good. \n",

        "6. From point 5, we will have the forecast number of inventory change. Then we can also use this variable as the input to predict the house price. By doing this way, we can interact the visualization of \"Number of House Unit VS Population\"  with  the \"House Price and Inventory for Sales\" visualization. \n"
